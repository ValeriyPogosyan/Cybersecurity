sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:/home$ ls
adam  admin  amy  billy  http  instructor  jack  jane  joe  john  max  sally  sam  sara  student  sysadmin  user.hashes  usradd  vagrant

Ensure that only the admin has general sudo access.
Command to add admin to the sudo group:
sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:/home$ sudo usermod -aG sudo admin

sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:/home$ sudo -l -U admin
Matching Defaults entries for admin on UbuntuDesktop:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User admin may run the following commands on UbuntuDesktop:
    (ALL) ALL
    (ALL : ALL) ALL

Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder

Add an engineers group to the system.
Command to add group:
sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:/home$ sudo addgroup engineers
[sudo] password for sysadmin: 
Adding group `engineers' (GID 1019) ...
Done.

Add users sam, joe, amy, and sara to the managed group.
Command to add users to engineers group (include all four users):

sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:/home$ sudo addgroup sam engineers
Adding user `sam' to group `engineers' ...
Adding user sam to group engineers
Done.
sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:/home$ sudo addgroup joe engineers
Adding user `joe' to group `engineers' ...
Adding user joe to group engineers
Done.
sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:/home$ sudo addgroup amy engineers
Adding user `amy' to group `engineers' ...
Adding user amy to group engineers
Done.
sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:/home$ sudo addgroup sara engineers
Adding user `sara' to group `engineers' ...
Adding user sara to group engineers
Done.

Create a shared folder for this group at /home/engineers.

sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:/home$ sudo mkdir engineers

Change ownership on the new engineers' shared folder to the engineers group.
Command to change ownership of engineer's shared folder to engineer group:
sudo chgrp -R engineers engineers

sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:/home$ ls -ld engineers/
drwxr-xr-x 2 root engineers 4096 Oct 10 21:01 engineers/

Step 4: Lynis Auditing
The final step on your administrator's list involves running an audit against the system in order to harden it. You'll use the system and security auditing tool Lynis to do so.

Step 4: Lynis Auditing

Command to install Lynis:
Install the Lynis package to your system if it is not already installed.
apt-get install lynis

/usr/sbin/lynis

Command to see documentation and instructions:
root@UbuntuDesktop:/# man lynis

Command to run an audit:
root@UbuntuDesktop:/# ./usr/sbin/lynis audit system > /home/lynis_file

Provide a report from the Lynis output on what can be done to harden the system.

Bonus
Command to install chkrootkit:
root@UbuntuDesktop:/# apt-get install chkrootkit

Command to see documentation and instructions:
man chkrootkit

Command to run expert mode:
root@UbuntuDesktop:/# chkrootkit -x
